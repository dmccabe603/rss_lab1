That my days have been a dream;
Is but a dream within a dream.
In a vision, or in none,
In a vision, or in none,
But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not save
How few! yet how they creep
Yet if hope has flown away
O God! can I not save
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
And, in parting from you now,
In a night, or in a day,
All that we see or seem
And I hold within my hand
Them with a tighter clasp?
And, in parting from you now,
But a dream within a dream?And, in parting from you now,
Is all that we see or seem

Is it therefore the less gone?
O God! can I not grasp
That my days have been a dream;
