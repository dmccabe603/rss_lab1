-That my days have been a dream;
-Is but a dream within a dream.
-In a vision, or in none,
-In a vision, or in none,
-But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not save
-How few! yet how they creep
-Yet if hope has flown away
-O God! can I not save
-In a night, or in a day,
-In a vision, or in none,
-Is it therefore the less gone?
-And, in parting from you now,
-In a night, or in a day,
-All that we see or seem
-And I hold within my hand
-Them with a tighter clasp?
-And, in parting from you now,
-But a dream within a dream?And, in parting from you now,
-Is all that we see or seem

-Is it therefore the less gone?
-O God! can I not grasp
-That my days have been a dream;
+One from the pitiless wave?
+But a dream within a dream?
