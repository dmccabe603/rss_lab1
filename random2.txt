In a vision, or in none,
O God! can I not save
O God! can I not save
O God! can I not grasp
While I weep--while I weep!
Yet if hope has flown away
All that we see or seem
Through my fingers to the deep,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
But a dream within a dream?O God! can I not grasp
You are not wrong, who deem
Thus much let me avow--
